#Description	Unique anonymous/de-identified provider ID for the patient	Unique ID of the patient tissue sample used to rate PDX(s)	"Date of collections - if this is not avalaible please indicate in column E, F collection events and the elapsed times between the colletcion. Important for understanding the time relationship between models generated for the same patient."	"IF DATE ENTERED IN collection_date - DON'T FILL - collection event order collection 1 correspond to the 1st time a patient was  sampled to generate a PDX, subsequent events are incremented by 1 - if a different collection took"	"IF DATE ENTERED IN collection_date - DON'T FILL, if not please provide the time difference between the 1st collection event and the current one (in months) - collection event 1  should be 0, collection event 2 should be 6 if 6 months have elapase between collection 1 and  collection 2 and collection event 3 should be 9 if 9 months have elapsed between collection 1 and collection 3 "	"Patient age at collection. Can be exact age or binned in 10 y group (1-9, 10-19, 20-29, ...)"	diagnosis at time of collection of the patient tumour used in xenograft  - use a NCIT ontology term when possible	"Collected tumour type. Please use either: Primary, Metastastic, Local relapse"	Site of the primary tumor where primary cancer is originating from (may not correspond to the site of the current tissue sample). Use NCIT ontology term where possible. No abbreviations.	Site of collection of the tissue sample (can be different than the primary site if tumour type is metastatic)	Stage of the patient at the time of collection. Should be in the format of the stage classification	Stage classification system used to describe the stage. Add the version if available.	The implanded tumour grade value.	"Grade classification corresponding used to describe the stage, or Not provided Add the version if available."	"Positive virology status at the time of collection. Any relevent virology information which can infliuence cancer like EBV, HIV,HPV status. Use the virus name in NCIT ontology - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncit"	Is patient treatement information avalaible and sharable? If yes fill out following treatment columns as well as treatment data sheet - can be sent later if time consuming.	"Has the patient ever been treated by an anti-cancer agent currently (at the time of collection) OR previsouly (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy) at the time of the collection of the tumour?"	"Was the patient being treated for cancer (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy) at the time of collection"	"Was the patient previously treated prior to the collection (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy)"	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample. Needs to be unique to represent an aggregated PDX line : combination between a mouse strain and a unique grafted tumour sample
